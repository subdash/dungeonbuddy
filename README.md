## What is Dungeon Buddy?
Dungeon Buddy is a project that is currently still in the works.

**What is here right now**

- A basic API that can pull data from roll20.net
- A single basic test that is about as extensive as the API at this point

**What is planned**

A web app or mobile app where you can...
- Make and store a character sheet
- Easily access skills, spells, and any information a player or DM could need
- User roles (player, dungeon master, etc.)
- Much, much more
